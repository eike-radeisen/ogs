This section will address useful features of OpenGeoSys, for which it takes more to use then than adding an appropriate tag /
block to the project file. Some of them require additional software to be installed, special compilation flags used, or separate
files to be provided via their path passed to the project file.

The following features are described in more detail:

* [MFront](/docs/userguide/features/mfront/)
* [Python boundary condition](/docs/userguide/features/python_bc/)
* [Running OpenGeoSys with MPI](/docs/userguide/features/parallel_computing_mpi/)
