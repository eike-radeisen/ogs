## Test cases

Five tests are presented:

{{< data-link >}}

of which the last three have the same test program but use different implementations of the modified Cam clay model.
The MFront-files can be found at [here](https://gitlab.opengeosys.org/ogs/ogs/-/tree/master/MaterialLib/SolidModels/MFront).

## Problem description

We perform plane strain and axisymmetric mechanical tests using
the modified Cam clay model revealing both the features and
the limitations of this material model.
See [this PDF](ModifiedCamClay_report.pdf) for the detailed description.
