## XYZ Process

## Introduction/Summary/Brief description

The idea is to briefly describe each process here including some theoretical background, specific requirements or tags used only by this process.

## Theoretical background

Brief summary of theory behind specific process.
Equations are welcome, but not mandatory.
Avoid going to deep into details here.
Only describe aspects important for the users or extraordinary implementation decisions.
Everything else can be communicated by naming papers in section References.

## Implementation

Most important aspects / ideas.
Links to Doxygen / source code can be included.
Parts of the source too.

### Supported phases

List of supported phases.

### Supported variables and parameters

List of variables and parameters that can be used with this process.

## Known issues and limitations

## Quirks and features

## Usage in project file

## Benchmarks

List of recommended (not necessary all of them) benchmarks, that users should investigate first.
They should be selected with two goals:

1. Provide an overview of all aspects and features of the process
2. Ease of identifying differences between them, so that user can quickly develop understanding how certain feature impact the simulation.
