## Description

This tool can be used to check the validity of the input mesh and optionally output mesh properties (specifically MaterialIDs).

## Usage

```bash
USAGE:
   checkMesh  [-p] [-v] [--] [--version] [-h] <string>


Where:
   -p,  --print_properties
     print properties stored in the mesh

   -v,  --validation
     validate the mesh

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.

   <string>
     (required)  input mesh file

```

## Example

In this example we use a 3D mesh from another example ([createLayeredMeshfromRasters]({{< ref "createLayeredMeshfromRasters.md" >}})).

```bash
checkMesh mesh_layered.vtu -p -v
```

 **general output:**
 At first there are some general information given.

 **-p output:**
 The properties output refers to material properties.
 The bounds of the materialID vector are [0,6].
 Also, the corresponding list is given as: MaterialID-list: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

 ```bash

 **-v output:**
 The quality of the underlying mesh is checked and no errors are found.
